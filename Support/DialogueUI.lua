-- Cinematic: DialogueUI (Dialogue UI), which swaps the game's gossip and
-- quest windows for its own (DUIQuestFrame), with its own gamepad controls.
-- It stops the game's windows opening at all (it unregisters their events),
-- so Quest talk (Custom dialogue frames) never comes up beside it: that only
-- opens over a game window. Where DialogueUI steps aside (in instances, with
-- its option), the game's windows come back, and with them ours.
--
-- Its camera (Camera Movement: zoom in on the NPC, or pan; on to start with)
-- moves the view as a talk starts and puts it back as it ends. While its
-- window's up with that on, it holds the camera lock (ns.RegisterCamera), so
-- the quest camera and our others wait; with Camera Movement off in its
-- settings, ours play as usual. Shoulder Cam leaves the shoulder offset alone
-- meanwhile (DialogueUI sets that same setting for its shot).
