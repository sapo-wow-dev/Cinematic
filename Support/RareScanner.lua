-- Cinematic: RareScanner. Its alert is one button (RARESCANNER_BUTTON, the
-- rare's name, model and loot, a click to target it), at the bottom of the
-- screen as it finds a rare, treasure or event. It fades as its own row on
-- the Advanced Frames page. For a rare NPC, Rare spotted's card can stand in
-- for it (its row on Addons > Conflicts, Ours while
-- unpicked): its button goes as it comes up and our card shows, with
-- RareScanner's sound and chat line as it has them. Theirs: its button as
-- before, and our card stays quiet for the rares it showed. Treasures and
-- events keep its button either way. Its button only comes up out of fights
-- (it's a secure button), so hiding it is too.
