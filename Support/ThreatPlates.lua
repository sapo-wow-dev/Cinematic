-- Cinematic: Threat Plates (TidyPlates_ThreatPlates), nameplates of its own.
--
-- Fade. It puts a frame of its own on each game plate (plate.TPFrame, named
-- ThreatPlatesFrame...) and hides the game's unit frame under it, for the
-- units it draws. Its frame ignores the plate's alpha (it does its own range
-- and target fading), so a faded game plate left it at full: the fade goes on
-- its frame, hooked as it sets its own alpha all the time (ours times its
-- own: ns.SetPlateFrameAlpha). A unit it leaves to the game keeps the game's
-- unit frame, faded as usual.
--
-- Settings. With its friendly plates set to show out of fights only, it
-- switches the game's friendly plate settings around each fight, the ones
-- the Nameplates page's rows decide: those writes count as its own passes
-- and the rows are switched on again after them (ns.FollowOthersPlateWrites).
-- Its occlusion option writes the game's plate alpha settings; those are
-- left to it.
