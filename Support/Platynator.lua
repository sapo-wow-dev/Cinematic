-- Fade. It moves each game plate's unit frame into a hidden frame of its own
-- and draws its own plate on top: made per game plate (NamePlate1 has the
-- first, and so on) and parented to it, never moved to another. So the
-- fade leaves the game's unit frame be (ns.addonPlateHidden) and goes on its
-- plate instead. It sets that plate's alpha itself all the time (target,
-- mouseover, range), so it's hooked: ours times its own
-- (ns.SetPlateFrameAlpha).

-- Settings. At login, on each loading screen and after a fight it writes the
-- game's "which plates show" settings from its own options, the ones the
-- Nameplates page's rows decide: those writes count as its own passes and
-- the rows are switched on again after them (ns.FollowOthersPlateWrites).
