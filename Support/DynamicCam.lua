-- Cinematic: DynamicCam, a camera addon. It has no frames on screen to fade
-- (only its settings windows), but it drives the same camera ours do:
--
--  - Its zoom ("reactive zoom", on to start with) swaps the game's zoom
--    functions for its own, which add steps to a zoom and stop its own
--    glide. Our cameras' zooms go to the game's own instead (ns.zoomBypass,
--    Camera.lua), so they go the distance they ask for. It swaps them again
--    with each of its situation changes, which drops our hook that sees your
--    own scroll-wheel zooms: hooked again each time.
--  - Its situations (off to start with) can zoom, turn the camera or go to a
--    saved view as you take a flight, hearth, go AFK, fish or talk to an NPC:
--    the same moments as our scenes. Each one that's on with a camera move
--    gets an Addon Conflicts row (AddonSupport.lua): Theirs (the default)
--    and our scene stands aside; Ours and its situation counts as off while
--    it picks one, so it never starts it. Not Both: two cameras on one view
--    fight.
--  - It writes its camera settings (zoom, turn speeds, field of view...) on
--    each situation change. One we hold for a move of ours (a slow turn's
--    speed, a set's value) keeps ours: its value becomes the one put back
--    when ours lets go.
--  - It owns the shoulder offset (it writes it on every situation change):
--    Shoulder Cam stands aside while it's loaded (ShoulderCam.lua).
--
-- Its UI fade (a situation's Hide UI) fades the whole UI and holds it there;
-- we never set the whole UI's alpha, so nothing fights. Its hooks on the
-- tooltip and quest windows don't touch ours.
