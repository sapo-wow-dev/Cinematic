-- Cinematic: Spoken, which reads the game aloud (quests and gossip with
-- Spoken Quests, places, books, bosses with its other parts), with a narrator
-- window and subtitles on screen while a line plays.
--
-- Its narrator windows (the full one and the minimal one) and its subtitles
-- are named frames on UIParent, a row each. All three fade themselves in and
-- out as lines start and end, so they're hooked: faded, it's ours times
-- theirs. Its narrator over Dialogue UI moves onto Dialogue UI's window and
-- goes with it, so it has no row. Its minimap button is a LibDBIcon one,
-- handled with the rest.
--
-- Quest talk (Custom dialogue frames) parks the game's quest window off the
-- screen, and Spoken Quests pins its Listen button to that window, so the
-- button went with it. Ours gets Spoken's own round Play button instead, in
-- the bubble's top right corner: it reads the open quest (Spoken Quests'
-- /spqread) or, while a line plays, skips it.
