-- Profile choices: what players pick, and what each pick is made of. The
-- one file to change to shape the experience; the settings themselves are
-- in modules (ProfileModules.lua), and the welcome window, the Profiles
-- page and the dev build's Module Editor all read from here.
--
-- Three layers, each built from the one below:
--   Modules (ProfileModules.lua): a set of settings for the pages, or
--     sections of pages, it names.
--   Choices (ns.SLOT_CHOICES, here): each slot (an area of your setup:
--     the interface, action bars, camera...) has a few choices, and a
--     choice is a list of modules. Picking one swaps the slot's settings
--     for the choice's and leaves the rest as they are (ns.ApplyPart).
--   Profiles (ns.BUILTIN_PROFILES, here): a pick per slot (picks), on top
--     of the profile it's from (from), plus any modules of its own
--     (modules). A slot it doesn't pick has its default choice.
-- The welcome window's levels (ns.WELCOME_LEVELS, here) each pick a profile.
--
-- To change what a choice does, change its modules. To add one, add it to
-- its slot's choices (with hidden = true it's only for profiles, not offered
-- to players). To add a slot, add it to ns.PROFILE_SLOTS and ns.SLOT_CHOICES.
-- The dev build's Module Editor does all of this in the game and gives the
-- Lua to paste back here. lua5.1 Tools/offline/check.lua (and /cine debug
-- modules) checks that it all fits together.
