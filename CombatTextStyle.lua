-- The Style hub's Combat Text Style (Tools/combat-text-plan.md): our own
-- damage and healing numbers over nameplates, drawn to look like the game's
-- floating world text. The game can't hide its "XP: 35" alone (one font
-- draws all its world text), so with its text blanked (hideWorldText) these
-- stand in for the damage numbers, without the XP.
--
-- Where they come from: UNIT_COMBAT, one listener per nameplate unit (a
-- listener for all units gets each hit 3-4 times: the plate, target,
-- softenemy). The amount is secret on Forever (in fights): never compared,
-- only put on a text with SetText, which takes it. The kind of hit, crit
-- flag and school are plain.
--
-- Where they show: on the plate itself (the base plate, not the UnitFrame
-- CineMode fades), in the plate's strata just above it, so they're over
-- every plate's art. A plate that goes (the mob died, the kill shot's
-- number still rising) leaves its numbers where it last was. A locked
-- (forbidden) plate gets none. How they move: matched by eye to the game's
-- (the constants below); its size and duration CVars still scale them.
--
-- The page (below): its Enable Page; ours on or off; whose hits; heals,
-- misses, school colors, the crit pop; font, outline, size, height; and the
-- game's own text: its damage and healing numbers off (CVars, at once), and
-- all of it, XP too (the blank font, Core.lua, from the next game start).

-- Whose hit -------------------------------------------------------------------
-- UNIT_COMBAT never says who hit, so a party member's swing on your mob
-- showed as yours (seen 2026-11-10). The game's combat log does, but its
-- lines come as protected text (COMBAT_LOG_MESSAGE: "|Ky16|k"): unreadable,
-- yet they come, and with Blizzard's filter as it stands (yours: you and your
-- pet) a line comes with each hit of yours and none with a teammate's. So a
-- hit is yours when a line comes within HOLD of it, one line per hit (a hit
-- waits up to HOLD for one; a line waits as long for its hit). Lines come
-- only while the log's filtered events are on, which Blizzard turns on and
-- off with its combat log tab: while our numbers are on we keep them on, and
-- turn them back off if we did. No log (a client without it): every hit
-- counts, and in a group only your target's.
--
-- From a recording of two fights (/cine debug combattext, Forever, a druid
-- as caster then bear, 2026-11-11):
-- - A spell's hit and its line come in the same instant, either first.
-- - A swing's line (a hit, a miss, a parry) comes 0.3 to 0.75 s BEFORE its
--   hit on the plate (the plate's hit waits for the swing to land on
--   screen). With HOLD alone every swing was left out: no numbers in bear
--   form. So a line is kept MELEE_HOLD, and a swing takes the oldest kept;
--   anything else only one HOLD fresh.
-- - A hit on you (or a miss) comes with no line at all; held one back for it
--   before, which took the line of a hit of yours landing just after. Your
--   heals on yourself do come with one, so those alone still take theirs.
-- - Maul comes as two hits in one instant with one line: one number, as the
