-- Shoulder Cam (shoulderCam): the camera sits over your shoulder (right, or
-- left: shoulderCamSide), you to the side of the screen. It's the game's
-- test_cameraOverShoulder offset (yards, negative for the left), which it
-- eases over to on its own (in about 0.3 s: Run 3). That's a fixed distance,
-- so the closer the camera the further aside it pushes you: 1 yard is 5% of
-- the way to the screen's edge at 15 yards away, 41% at 2 (Run 3b). So you
-- pick a spot instead (shoulderCamSpot: that share of the way from the middle
-- to the edge) and the offset follows your zoom to hold you there, eased back
-- to the middle closer than SPOT_EASE_TO yards. The game ignores that while Keep
-- Character Centered (Accessibility) is on, so that's turned off meanwhile, and
-- CameraReduceUnexpectedMovement too (the same since 11.0.2, as DynamicCam found).
-- It's one of Blizzard's experimental camera settings: writing it brings up
-- their warning, once a session, and the game clears the offset at every
-- reload and login (Forever, Run 2 of Tools/shoulder-test-plan.md), so theirs
-- would come every session. Ours instead, once ever (db.shoulderCamNoticed,
-- not part of a profile): until it's accepted nothing's written, and Cancel
-- turns the Shoulder Cam off. After that the game's warning is kept quiet
-- while it's on: its event stopped, as DynamicCam and DialogueUI do (Run 2b:
-- none at the write, a reload or a relog). The game can't be told to hear it
-- again, so after turning off it's back from the next /reload.
-- Your own settings (db.shoulderCamYours) come back as it's turned off.
-- Disable (ResetTestCvars) turns it off here too.
-- (Not ns.ApplyCVarSet: Keep Character Centered would be put back on logout.)
--
-- It's a held setting, not a camera: it doesn't move the view, so it doesn't
-- claim the camera lock. It goes to 0 (paused) while mounted
-- (shoulderCamNotMounted), indoors (shoulderCamNotIndoors) and while one of Cinematic's cameras that frame you
-- runs (shoulderCamPause): the standing-still ones (cozy, vista, fish, AFK,
-- teleport), the flight camera and its fly-bys, and the death camera, whose
-- shots are built around you in the middle, and wherever its Show in row

-- on foot saves the one for your race and sex (db.shoulderCamScales, not part
-- of a profile), over the ones measured so far here. 1 until measured.
-- A shapeshift form is another model with its own factor: a Night Elf's bear
-- sat about twice as far out as the elf for the same offset (a 2026-11-11
-- recording: ~18% of the way to the edge, then ~35% each time bear form went
-- on, back each time it came off). So a form has its own key (race-sex-formN),

-- (A second recording, 18:46 that day, with 1.75 for the bear and 1 for the
-- elf and the spot at 20%: the bear rested at 21%, the elf at 16.5%.)
-- The model changes later than the form does on the way out: the game says
-- "no form" about 0.15 s before the bear's gone (that recording: with the
-- elf's offset written at once the bear swung out to ~40%, then the elf
-- snapped back to 16%). Into a form it's 0.06 to 0.1 s later (the log), and
-- an offset written at the form's change, ahead of it, jumped the whole view
-- sideways in one frame and crept back (a third recording, 18:51: a stump
-- beside you jumped 6% of the screen's width). Written in the model's own
-- frame (UNIT_MODEL_CHANGED) the game's change of factor and its ease to the
-- new offset cancel: out of bear form that way the view hardly moved. So at
-- any change of form the old factor's kept till the model's changed, or
-- SWAP_WAIT at most.
-- (That third recording, standing still: the elf rested on 20.1% with 0.82,
