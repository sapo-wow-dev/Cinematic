-- Cinematic: camera scripts (the Scripts page). A camera written as a list of
-- small steps: rotate, tilt, zoom (to a distance, or somewhere at random),
-- wait, line up behind you, do an emote, put everything back; Together runs
-- its steps side by side, Repeat runs them again (or until the camera ends).
-- Stop rules say what happens when you move the camera, a fight starts, you
-- walk, you zoom, or its trigger ends; When it ends is a list of steps of its
-- own (usually Put back). CameraScriptsPage.lua is the page that writes them.
--
-- A script is a camera like the built-in ones: a Cameras page row set to it
-- starts it (a standing-still trigger, one of your own, a Hearthstone or
-- teleport cast, or a flight), or Run on its page, or /cine script play.
-- The built-in ones are examples: the steps our own cameras take (fly-by,
-- quest cam, Chat Cam, AFK camera), with your settings, to copy.
--
-- The moves go out as the quest cam's do (QuestCam.lua says why at length):
-- one held turn, tilt or zoom per move, its speed setting stepped along an
-- eased curve, sent at the share of your speed setting that makes it the
-- move's top speed; a creep start under the lowest setting (no jump on the
-- first frame); a turn and a tilt can go together (a move's start stops the
-- other axis's, so that one is sent again: as Camera.lua's orbit sways), with
-- a short gap between one axis's moves; the zoom steered toward its eased path. Camera follow is off while
-- one runs. One camera at a time (ns.ClaimCamera): it holds the view from
-- start to end, and your camera input stops its moves at once.
--
-- Saved in db.cameraScripts (all profiles share it): list (your scripts),
-- nextId, preview (the preview window's place). A row's camera value for a
-- script is "script:<id>".
