-- Emote Vision: when someone buffs you, brings you back to life, emotes at
-- you, summons you, trades with you, levels up in your group, or you clear a
-- dungeon or finish a duel, a small card shows who it was and what they did,
-- with up to three emotes to answer in one click (each moment's picked on
-- its page: /thank, /bow, the same emote back...). It never shows in a
-- fight: a moment from one waits for the fight to end and is dropped if it's
-- grown old by then. One card at a time, the rest queued; repeats from the
-- same person (the same moment) ignored for a while, so a raid's buffer
-- doesn't flood you. Its look follows Visions Style (font, outline, shadow,
