-- Cinematic: the Camera Scripts page, where camera scripts are
-- written (CameraScripts.lua runs them), and the preview window beside it.
--
-- The page: the camera picked, by its name at the top: a click drops the
-- list of every camera down over the page (the Camera hub's groups, then
-- yours, New camera and Import), gone again as you pick one. Then Copy,
-- Delete and Share, what starts it (the Scenes page rows set to it), Run
-- now and Stop. Then its steps, a row each (Together and Repeat with theirs indented
-- under them): a click picks one and opens its settings under it; the
-- buttons below add a step after the one picked (inside it, for Together and
-- Repeat). Then the stop rules, and When it ends, another list of steps.
-- The built-in ones show their steps but don't change: Copy one first.
--
-- The preview window plays the script on a drawing (from above, and from
-- the side), no camera moving, over and over, with a bar of its steps in
-- time: a click on the drawing pauses it, on the bar jumps there. It sits
-- beside the settings (docked) or anywhere you drag it (Pop out), and stays
-- up when they close; its corner grip sizes it (the drawing grows with it).
