-- What's new > New features: the changes worth telling players about, each
-- added by hand (with the user's OK) as it's committed. Newest first by date
-- on the page, whatever the order here.
--   date    when it went in (YYYY-MM-DD)
--   title   a few words; text: a sentence or two, for players
--   page    the settings page it's on (English name, as ns.OpenOptions takes
--           it), for its icon and a Show me button; nil for none
--   client  "forever" or "retail": only listed on that client
-- Title and text go through L like the rest, so add them to esES.lua too.
